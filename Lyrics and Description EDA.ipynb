    "A: Assertion statements are beneficial in code because they help catch errors early by checking if assumptions hold true, improving the overall reliability of the code. They aid in debugging by acting as checkpoints that verify conditions during runtime, making it easier to identify logical issues. Additionally, assertions serve as self-documenting elements that clarify assumptions, enhancing code readability."

    "A: If we had left stopwords in the data, the \"top 5 words\" would likely be common, frequently used words such as \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and,\" \"a,\" and \"to.\" These words do not carry much meaningful information on their own because they are used in most English sentences. As a result, they would dominate the list of most common words, overshadowing the more content-rich and meaningful words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives, which are more relevant for analysis. Removing stopwords helps highlight the more significant words that contribute to the unique meaning of the text.\n",
